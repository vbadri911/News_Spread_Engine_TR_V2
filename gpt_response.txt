This task requires data analysis and cannot be completed without importing necessary libraries and data. However, here's an example of how you might structure the code:

```python
STOCKS = [
    "AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "FB", "GOOGL",
    "JPM", "JNJ", "V", "PG", "MA",
    "INTC", "UNH", "BAC", "T", "HD",
    "XOM", "DIS", "CMCSA", "KO", "PEP",
    "PFE", "NFLX"
]

EDGE_REASON = {
    "AAPL": "Information Technology - tech leader with weekly liquidity",
    "MSFT": "Information Technology - tech leader with weekly liquidity",
    "AMZN": "Consumer Discretionary - e-commerce giant with high IV",
    "FB": "Communication Services - social media leader with high IV",
    "GOOGL": "Communication Services - tech leader with weekly liquidity",
    "JPM": "Financials - bank with wide strikes and earnings volatility",
    "JNJ": "Health Care - stable dividend stock",
    "V": "Financials - payment service giant with high IV",
    "PG": "Consumer Staples - stable dividend stock",
    "MA": "Financials - payment service giant with high IV",
    "INTC": "Information Technology - tech leader with weekly liquidity",
    "UNH": "Health Care - stable dividend stock",
    "BAC": "Financials - bank with wide strikes and earnings volatility",
    "T": "Communication Services - telecom leader with stable dividends",
    "HD": "Consumer Discretionary - retail giant with stable dividends",
    "XOM": "Energy - energy company with commodity-driven IV",
    "DIS": "Communication Services - entertainment leader with high IV",
    "CMCSA": "Communication Services - cable giant with stable dividends",
    "KO": "Consumer Staples - stable dividend stock",
    "PEP": "Consumer Staples - stable dividend stock",
    "PFE": "Health Care - pharmaceutical giant with stable dividends",
    "NFLX": "Communication Services - streaming service leader with high IV"
}
```

Please note that the above code doesn't perform any data analysis or selection based on the criteria you provided. It's just an example of the output format. To select stocks based on given criteria, you would need to analyze historical data using libraries like pandas and yfinance, which is not possible without imports.
